        <h1>1 &ndash; <a name="1">Introduction</a></h1>

        <p>
        CScript is a lightweight embeddable scripting language.
        C in CScript refers to the C programming language as it mimics its
        syntax (as much as possible).
        It's syntax supports various types of programming styles and it does
        not enforce any type/style upon the user (it has all the tools and the
        user chooses the tool for the job).
        </p>

        <p>
        CScript is dynamically typed, it runs by interpreting bytecode with
        a stack-based virtual machine, and it's memory is automatically
        managed by the incremental garbage collection.
        </p>

        <p>
        CScript is implemented as a library fully written in C, and to be
        compiled with any standard C/C++ compiler implementing C99 standard.
        CScript distribution includes a host program called
        <code>cscript</code>, which is the interpreter that uses CScript
        library.
        CScript is intended to be primarily used as lightweight embeddable
        scripting language but also as a stand-alone language that is easy
        to learn as it shares most of its syntax with the C programming
        language and <a href="https://www.lua.org/">Lua</a>.
        </p>

        <p>
        CScript is free software, and is provided with no guarantees,
        as stated in its license.
        </p>

        <p>
        This manual is subject to changes, as the language itself changes.
        However the reference manual is always valid for the same version of
        CScript distribution. If you spot the mistake or you think the manual
        is lacking in various places, please let me know
        (<a href="https://github.com/b-jure/cscript">link</a> to the official
        git[hub] repository).
        </p>



        <h1>2 &ndash; <a name="2">Basic Concepts</a></h1>

        <p>
        This section describes the basic concepts of the language.
        </p>

        <h2>2.1 &ndash; <a name="2.1">Values and Types</a></h2>

        <p>
        CScript is a dynamically types language.
        This means that variables do not have types; only values do.
        There are no type definitions in the language instead all values
        carry their own type.
        </p>

        <p>
        All values in CScript are first-class values, meaning all values
        can be stored in variables (as is expected), passed as arguments
        to other functions and returned as results.
        </p>

        <p>
        There are eleven basic types in CScript:
        <em>nil</em>, <em>boolean</em>, <em>number</em>, <em>string</em>, 
        <em>function</em>, <em>userdata</em>, <em>thread</em>, <em>table</em>, 
        <em>array</em>, <em>class</em> and <em>instance</em>.
        </p>

        <p> <!-- nil -->
        The type <em>nil</em> has one single value, <b>nil</b>, and is
        intended to represent absence of value.
        </p>

        <p> <!-- boolean -->
        The type <em>boolean</em> has two values, <b>true</b> and <b>false</b>.
        Both <b>nil</b> and <b>false</b> make a condition false; they are
        collectively called <em>false values</em>
        (for example in C, we would consider <b>0</b> value as the
        <em>false value</em>).
        Any other value makes a condition true.
        So what is the difference between the <b>false</b> and <b>nil</b>?
        Here is a simple example, if we were to index a table with <b>nil</b>
        it would raise a runtime error; as said, use <b>nil</b> to indicate
        absence of value.
        </p>

        <p> <!-- number -->
        The type <em>number</em> represents both integer and real
        (floating-point) numbers, using two subtypes: <em>integer</em> and
        <em>float</em> (as is indicated in the C&nbsp;API header).

        Standard CScript uses 64-bit integers and double-precision (64-bit)
        floats. Configuration header can be tinkered to allow 32-bit integers
        and/or single-precision (32-bit) floats, but this but would probably
        require internal patches (see <code>cconf.h</code> if interested).

        Any overflow when manipulating integer values <em>wrap around</em>,
        according to the usual rules of two-complement arithmetics.
        This holds both for negative (signed) and positive (unsigned) integers.

        The conversion between the two subtypes mimics C standard.
        For example, if we were to do a mathematical operation between the two
        numbers, one of them is <em>integer</em> and the other is
        <em>float</em>, before the operation <em>integer</em> would be
        converted to a <em>float</em>.
        Additionally before the operation if the both numbers are of type
        <em>float</em> but both have <em>integer</em> representation, then
        they would be converted to <em>integers</em> before the operation
        (this would result in a slower operation on processors that support
        float division but this behaviour can also be configured in CScript
        internals quite easily, check <code>cvm.c</code>).
        </p>

        <p> <!-- string -->
        The type <em>string</em> represents immutable sequence of bytes.
        Strings can contain any 8-bit value, including embedded zeros
        ('<code>\0</code>').
        Internally CScript is encoding-agnostic; it makes no assumptions
        about the contents of a string.
        The length of any string in CScript must fit in a CScript integer.
        </p>

        <p> <!-- function -->
        The type <em>function</em> can be a function written in CScript or
        C, both of which can be manipulated and called.
        </p>

        <p> <!-- userdata -->
        The type <em>userdata</em> is provided to allow arbitrary C&nbsp;data
        to be stored in a variable.
        A userdata value represents a block of raw memory.
        There are two kinds of userdata:
        <em>full userdata</em>,
        which is an object with a block of memory managed by CScript,
        and <em>light userdata</em>,
        which is simply a C&nbsp;pointer value.
        Userdata has no predefined operations in CScript except assignment
        and identity test (<code>==</code>).
        By using <em>VMTs</em> (virtual method tables), the programmer can
        define operations for full userdata values.
        Userdata values cannot be created or modified in CScript, only
        through the C&nbsp;API.
        This guarantees the integrity of data owned by the host program
        and C&nbsp;libraries.
        </p>

        <p> <!-- table -->
        The type <em>table</em> implements associative arrays,
        that is, arrays that can have as indices not only numbers,
        but any CScript value except <b>nil</b> and NaN
        (<em>Not a Number</em> is a special floating-point value
        used by the IEEE 754 standard to represent undefined numerical
        results, such as <code>0/0</code>).

        Tables can be contain values of all types (except <b>nil</b>).
        Any key associated to the value <b>nil</b> is not considered part of
        the table. Conversely, any key that is not part of a table has
        an associated value <b>nil</b>.

        Tables can be indexed two different ways, given the key
        <code>name</code> we index the table <code>t</code> either as
        <code>t.name</code> or <code>t["name"]</code>.
        The array-like indexing is useful when we want to index the table
        with the value of the variable.
        </p>

        <p> <!-- array -->
        The type <em>array</em> is a linear collection of values each
        identified by an <b>index</b>. Each <b>index</b> is positive integer
        value or 0 which is used to index the <em>array</em> in order to
        retrieve the value (variable values can also be used in place of literal
        integers). Negative integer indices are not allowed.
        </p>

        <p> <!-- class -->
        The type <em>class</em> is useful for object-oriented programming.
        Class can contain <em>methods</em> which are defined upon class
        creation and can not be changed after.
        The reason why they can't be changed is because how inheritance is
        implemented internally, which in turn makes code much more manageable.
        <em>class</em> can inherit from another class, the name of the
        <em>class</em> from which we inherit is called a <em>superclass</em>.
        When inheriting all of the <em>superclass methods</em> are copied over
        to the <em>class</em> being created.

        When constructing a <em>class</em> programmer can define
        <em>metamethods</em> which are special functions that provide
        meta-programming functionality.
        </p>

        <p> <!-- instance -->
        The type <em>instance</em> is similar to <em>table</em>; it can be
        indexed and indexed values are the values of the <em>instance</em>
        <em>fields</em>. Each <em>instance</em> is constructed from a
        <em>class</em>.
        The <em>class</em> methods of the <em>instance</em> can't be changed
        but can be shadowed by creating a non <b>nil</b> <em>field</em> with
        the same key.
        </p>

        <p> <!-- thread -->
        The type <em>thread</em> represents independent threads of execution.
        CScript threads are not related to operating-system threads.
        </p>

        <p>
        The library function <a href=#type><code>type</code></a> returns a
        string describing the type of a given value.
        </p>

        <h1>6 &ndash; <a name="6">The Standard Libraries</h1>
        <p>
        The standard CScript libraries provide useful functions that are
        implemented in&nbsp;C through the C&nbsp;API.
        Most of these functions provide essential service to the
        language that is not express via the language syntax and others
        provide access to outside services (e.g., I/O).
        <br/>
        All libraries are implemented through the official C&nbsp;API and are
        provided as separate C&nbsp;modules.
        <br/>
        The notation <b>fail</b> means a false value representing some kind of
        failure (the recommendation is to always test the success of these
        functions with <code>(!status)</code>, instead of
        <code>(status == nil)</code>).
        </p>

        <p>
        Currently, CScript has the following standard libraries:
        </p>
        <ul>
            <li>basic library (<a href="#6.1">&sect;6.1</a>);</li>
            <li>string library (<a href="#6.2">&sect;6.2</a>);</li>
            <li>math library (<a href="#6.3">&sect;6.3</a>);</li>
            <li>utf-8 library (<a href="#6.4">&sect;6.4</a>);</li>
            <li>input-output library (<a href="#6.5">&sect;6.5</a>);</li>
            <li>operating system library (<a href="#6.6">&sect;6.6</a>);</li>
        </ul>

        <p>
        To have access to these libraries, the C&nbsp;host program should
        call the <a href="#csL_open_libs"><code>csL_openlibs</code></a>
        function, which opens all standard libraries.
        Alternatively, the host program can open them individually by using
        <a href="#csL_include"><code>csL_include</code></a> to call
        <a name="csL_open_base"><code>csL_open_base</code></a> (for the basic library),
        <a name="csL_open_string"><code>csL_open_string</code></a> (for the string library),
        <a name="csL_open_utf8"><code>csL_open_utf8</code></a> (for the UTF-8 library),
        <a name="csL_open_math"><code>csL_open_math</code></a> (for the math library),
        <a name="csL_open_io"><code>csL_open_io</code></a> (for the I/O library),
        <a name="csL_open_os"><code>csL_open_os</code></a> (for the operating system library),
        These functions are declared in <a name="cslib.h"><code>cslib.h</code></a>
        </p>



        <h2>6.1 &ndash; <a name="6.1">Basic Library</a></h2>
        <p>
        The basic library provides core functions to CScript.
        </p>

        <p> <!-- error -->
        <hr/><h3><a name="error"><code>error (message [, level])</code></a></h3>
        Raises an error with <code>message</code> as the error object.
        This function never returns.
        <br/> <br/>
        Usually, <code>error</code> adds some information about the error position
        at the beginning of the message, if the message is a string.
        The <code>level</code> argument specifies how to get the error position.
        With level&nbsp;0 (the default), the error position is where the
        <code>error</code> function was called.
        Level&nbsp;1 points the error to where the function
        that called <code>error</code> was called; and so on.
        Passing a negative level (e.g., <code>-1</code>) avoids the addition
        of error position information to the message.
        </p>

        <p> <!-- assert -->
        <hr/><h3><a name="assert"><code>assert (v [, message])</code></a></h3>
        Raises an error if the value of its argument <code>v</code> is false
        (i.e., <b>nil</b> or <b>false</b>); otherwise, returns all its arguments.
        <br/><br/>
        In case of error, <code>message</code> is the error object;
        when absent, it defaults to "<code>assertion failed!</code>"
        </p>

        <p> <!-- gc -->
        <hr/><h3><a name="gc"><code>gc ([opt [, arg]])</code></a></h3>
        This function is a generic interface to the garbage collector.
        It performs different functions according to its first argument,
        <code>opt</code>:
        <ul>
            <li>
                <b>"<code>collect</code>": </b>
                Performs a full garbage-collection cycle.
                This is the default option.
            </li>
            <li>
                <b>"<code>stop</code>": </b>
                Stops automatic execution of the garbage collector.
                The collector will run only when explicitly invoked,
                until a call to restart it.
            </li>
            <li>
                <b>"<code>restart</code>": </b>
                Restarts automatic execution of the garbage collector.
            </li>
            <li>
                <b>"<code>count</code>": </b>
                Returns the total memory in use by CScript in Kbytes.
                The value has a fractional part, so that it multiplied by
                1024 gives the exact number of bytes in use by CScript.
            </li>
            <li>
                <b>"<code>step</code>": </b>
                Performs a garbage-collection step.
                The step "size" is controlled by <code>arg</code>.
                With a zero value, the collector will perform one basic
                (indivisible) step.
                For non-zero values, the collector will perform as if that
                amount of memory (in Kbytes) had been allocated by CScript.
                Returns <b>true</b> if the step finished a collection cycle.
            </li>
            <li>
                <b>"<code>isrunning</code>": </b>
                Returns a boolean that tells whether the collector is running
                (i.e., not stopped).
            </li>
            <li>
                <b>"<code>incremental</code>": </b>
                Change the collector mode to incremental.
                This option can be followed by three numbers:
                the garbage-collector pause, the step multiplier,
                and the step size. A zero means to not change that value.
            </li>
        </ul>
        This function should not be called by a finalizer (<code>__gc</code>).
        </p>

        <p> <!-- load -->
        <hr/><h3><a name="load"><code>load (chunk [, chunkname])</code></a></h3>
        Loads a chunk.
        <br/><br/>
        If <code>chunk</code> is a string, the chunk is this string.
        If <code>chunk</code> is a function, <code>load</code> calls it
        repeatedly to get the chunk pieces. Each call to <code>chunk</code>
        must return a string that concatenates with previous results.
        A return of an empty string, <b>nil</b>, or no value signals the end
        of the chunk.
        If there are no syntactic errors, <code>load</code> returns the
        compiled chunk as a function; otherwise, it returns <b>fail</b> plus
        the error message.
        <br/> <br/>
        <code>chunkname</code> is used as the name of the chunk for error
        messages and debug information.
        When absent, it defaults to <code>chunk</code>, if <code>chunk</code>
        is a string, or to "<code>=(load)</code>" otherwise.
        </p>

        <p> <!-- loadfile -->
        <hr/><h3><a name="loadfile"><code>loadfile ([filename])</code></a></h3>
        Similar to <a href="#load"><code>load</code></a>,
        but gets the chunk from file <code>filename</code> or from the
        standard input, if no file name is given.
        </p>

        <p> <!-- runfile -->
        <hr/><h3><a name="runfile"><code>runfile ([filename])</code></a></h3>
        Opens the named file and executes its content as a CScript chunk.
        When called without arguments, <code>runfile</code> executes the
        content of the standard input (<code>stdin</code>).
        Returns all values returned by the chunk.
        In case of errors, <code>runfile</code> propagates the error to its
        caller (that is, <code>runfile</code> does not run in protected mode).
        </p>

        <p> <!-- getmetamethod -->
        <hr/><h3><a name="getmetamethod"><code>getmetamethod (v, name)</code></a></h3>
        Returns the metamethod of the given <code>v</code> or <b>nil</b>
        if <code>v</code> does not have virtual method table and/or the
        <code>v</code> does not implement the metamethod <code>name</code>.
        </p>

        <p> <!-- next -->
        <hr/><h3><a name="next"><code>next (v [, index])</code></a></h3>
        Allows a program to traverse of all fields of <code>v</code>.
        Its first argument is a table or instance and its second argument
        is an index into this table/instance.
        A call to <code>next</code> returns the next index of the
        <code>v</code> and its associated value.
        When called with <b>nil</b> as its second argument, <code>next</code>
        returns an initial index and its associated value.
        When called with the last index, or with <b>nil</b> in an empty
        table or instance without fields, <code>next</code> returns <b>nil</b>.
        If the second argument is absent, then it is interpreted as <b>nil</b>.
        In particular, you can use <code>next(v)</code> to check whether a
        table is empty or if the instance has no fields.
        <br/><br/>
        The order in which the indices are enumerated is not specified.
        <br/><br/>
        You should not assign any value to a non-existent field in a table
        during its traversal. You may however modify existing fields.
        In particular, you may set existing fields to <b>nil</b>.
        </p>

        <p> <!-- pairs -->
        <hr/><h3><a name="pairs"><code>pairs (v)</code></a></h3>
        Returns three values: the <a href="#next"><code>next</code></a>
        function, <code>v</code>, and <b>nil</b>, so that the construction
        <pre>   foreach k,v in pairs(v) <em>body</em></pre>
        will iterate over all key&ndash;value pairs of <code>v</code>;
        <code>v</code> should be either a <em>table</em> or <em>instance</em>.
        <br/><br/>
        See function <a href="next"><code>next</code></a> for the caveats
        of modifying the table or instance fields during its traversal.
        </p>

        <p> <!-- ipairs -->
        <hr/><h3><a name="ipairs"><code>ipairs (a)</code></a></h3>
        Returns three values (an iterator function, the array <code>a</code>,
        and -1)
        so that the construction
        <pre>   foreach i,v in ipairs(a) <em>body</em></pre>
        will iterate over the index&ndash;value pairs
        (<code>0,a[0]</code>), (<code>1,a[1]</code>), ...,
        up to the <em>length</em> of the array <code>a</code>.
        </p>

        <p> <!-- pcall -->
        <hr/><h3><a name="pcall"><code>pcall (f [, arg1, &middot;&middot;&middot;])</code></a></h3>
        Calls the function <code>f</code> with the given arguments in
        <em>protected mode</em>.
        This means that any error inside&nbsp;<code>f</code> is not propagated;
        instead, <code>pcall</code> catches the error and returns a status code.
        Its first result is the status code (a boolean), which is <b>true</b>
        if the call succeeds without errors.
        In such case, <code>pcall</code> also returns all results from the call,
        after this first result.
        <br/> <br/>
        In case of any error, <code>pcall</code> returns <b>false</b> plus the error object.
        Note that errors caught by <code>pcall</code> do not call a message handler.
        </p>

        <p> <!-- xpcall -->
        <hr/><h3><a name="xpcall"><code>xpcall (f, msgh [, arg1, &middot;&middot;&middot;])</code></a></h3>
        This function is similar to <a href="#pcall"><code>pcall</code></a>,
        except that it sets a new message handler <code>msgh</code>.
        </p>

        <p> <!-- print -->
        <hr/><h3><a name="print"><code>print (&middot;&middot;&middot;)</code></a></h3>
        Receives any number of arguments and prints their values to
        <code>stdout</code>, converting each argument to a string
        following the same rules of <a href="#tostring"><code>tostring</code></a>.
        <br/> <br/>
        The function <code>print</code> is not intended for formatted output,
        but only as a quick way to show a value, for instance for debugging.
        For complete control over the output, use
        <a href="#io.printf"><code>io.printf</code></a> and
        <a href="#io.write"><code>io.write</code></a>.
        </p>

        <p> <!-- warn -->
        <hr/><h3><a name="warn"><code>warn (msg1, &middot;&middot;&middot;)</code></a></h3>
        Emits a warning with a message composed by the concatenation
        of all its arguments (which should be strings).
        <br/> <br/>
        By convention, a one-piece message starting with '<code>@</code>'
        is intended to be a <em>control message</em>,
        which is a message to the warning system itself.
        In particular, the standard warning function in CScript
        recognizes the control messages "<code>@off</code>",
        to stop the emission of warnings, and "<code>@on</code>", to
        (re)start the emission; it ignores unknown control messages.
        </p>

        <p> <!-- len -->
        <hr/><h3><a name="len"><code>len (v)</code></a></h3>
        Returns the length of the object <code>v</code>, which must be
        array, table, instance or a string.
        <br/> <br/>
        <em>Array</em> length is total number of elements in use (one index
        above the biggest index that was set);
        <em>table</em> length is total number of keys with non-<b>nil</b>
        values; <em>instance</em> length is total number of fields with
        non-<b>nil</b> values; <em>string</em> length is size of string in
        bytes.
        <br/> <br/>
        Returns an integer.
        </p>

        <p> <!-- rawequal -->
        <hr/><h3><a name="rawequal"><code>rawequal (v1, v2)</code></a></h3>
        Checks whether <code>v1</code> is equal to <code>v2</code>,
        without invoking the <code>__eq</code> metamethod.
        <br/> <br/>
        Returns a boolean.
        </p>

        <p> <!-- rawget -->
        <hr/><h3><a name=rawget""><code>rawget (v, index)</code></a></h3>
        Gets the real value of <code>v[index]</code>,
        without calling the <code>__getidx</code> metamethod.
        <code>v</code> must be a array, table or instance;
        <code>index</code> may be any value if <code>v</code> is instance or a
        table; if <code>v</code> is array, <code>index</code> should be
        positive integer or 0.
        </p>

        <p> <!-- rawset -->
        <hr/><h3><a name="rawset"><code>rawset (v, index, value)</code></a></h3>
        Sets the real value of <code>v[index]</code> to <code>value</code>,
        without using the <code>__setidx</code> metamethod.
        <code>v</code> must be an array, table or instance;
        <code>index</code> any value different from <b>nil</b> and NaN if the
        <code>v</code> is a table or instance, otherwise <code>index</code>
        should be a positive integer or 0; <code>value</code> any CScript value.
        <br/> <br/>
        This function returns <code>v</code>.
        </p>

        <p> <!-- getargs -->
        <hr/><h3><a name="getargs"><code>getargs (index, &middot;&middot;&middot;)</code></a></h3>
        If <code>index</code> is a number, returns all arguments after
        argument number <code>index</code>; a negative number indexes from
        the end (-1 is the last argument).
        Otherwise, <code>index</code> must be one of these strings:
        <code>"array"</code>, <code>"table"</code> or <code>"len"</code>.
        <br/> <br/>
        In case <code>index</code> is <code>"array"</code> or
        <code>"table"</code> string then <code>getargs</code> returns
        the total number of extra arguments it received; <code>"array"</code>
        returns the extra arguments inside the array, <code>"table"</code>
        returns the extra arguments inside the table where each argument is
        a key with <b>true</b> value.
        <br/> <br/>
        However if <code>index</code> is 
        <code>"len"</code> string, then <code>getargs</code> returns integer
        corresponding to total number of extra arguments.
        </p>

        <p> <!-- tonumber -->
        <hr/><h3><a name="tonumber"><code>tonumber (v, [, base])</code></a></h3>
        When called with no <code>base</code>,
        <code>tonumber</code> tries to convert its argument to a number.
        If the argument <code>v</code> is already a number or a string
        convertible to a number, then <code>tonumber</code> returns this
        number and overflow flag; otherwise, it returns <b>fail</b>.
        <br/> <br/>
        The conversion of strings can result in integers or floats.
        The string may have leading and trailing spaces and a sign.
        The conversion mimics C standard library functions <code>strtod</code>
        and <code>strtol</code>.
        <br/> <br/>
        When called with <code>base</code>, then <code>v</code> must be a
        string to be interpreted as an integer numeral in that base.
        The base may be any integer between 2 and 36, inclusive.
        In bases above&nbsp;10, the letter '<code>A</code>' (in either upper
        or lower case) represents&nbsp;10, '<code>B</code>' represents&nbsp;11,
        and so forth, with '<code>Z</code>' representing 35.
        If the string <code>v</code> is not a valid numeral in the given base,
        the function returns <b>fail</b>.
        </p>

        <p> <!-- tostring -->
        <hr/><h3><a name="tostring"><code>tostring (v)</code></a></h3>
        Receives a value of any type and converts it to a string in a
        human-readable format.
        </p>

        <p> <!-- typeof -->
        <hr/><h3><a name="typeof"><code>typeof (v)</code></a></h3>
        Returns the type of its only argument, coded as a string.
        The possible results of this function are
        "<code>nil</code>" (a string, not the value <b>nil</b>),
        "<code>number</code>",
        "<code>string</code>",
        "<code>boolean</code>",
        "<code>array</code>",

        <p> <!-- __G -->
        <hr/><h3><a name="__G"><code>__G</code></a></h3>
        A global variable (not a function) that holds the global table
        (see <a href="#2.2">&sect;2.2</a>).
        <br/>
        CScript itself does not use this variable;
        changing its value does not affect any environment, nor vice versa.
        </p>

        <p> <!-- __VERSION -->
        <hr/><h3><a name="__VERSION"><code>__VERSION</code></a></h3>
        A global variable (not a function) that holds a string containing

        <h2>6.2 &ndash; <a name="6.2">String Library</a></h2>
        <p>
        This library provides generic functions for string manipulation,
        such as finding and extracting substrings and other common operations.
        All of the functionality is provided in the global class 
        <a name="String"><code>String</code></a>.
        When indexing <code>String</code> instance in CScript, the first
        character is at position &nbsp;0 (same as in C).
        Indices are allowed to be negative and are interpreted as indexing
        backwards, from the end of the <code>String</code>.
        Thus, the last character is at position -1, and so on.
        <br/>
        The string library assumes one-byte character encodings.
